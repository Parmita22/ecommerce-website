The E-commerce Website project, built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, features a secure login and registration system with password hashing to protect user data. It displays products with detailed descriptions, images, and prices. Users can add, update, and remove items from their shopping cart, and manage their orders and order history. An admin panel allows for easy management of products, categories, and user accounts. The website uses MySQL for reliable and scalable data storage.
